I cannot create binary PNG image files directly in a text-based response. PNG files contain binary data that cannot be represented as plain text in this interface.

To create the image files referenced in the README, you would need to:

1. Generate actual PNG images using the NanoCov tool with different themes
2. Manually save those images to the appropriate paths in the docs/images directory
3. Or use a placeholder image generator tool to create the necessary files

For now, you could replace the image references in the README with text indicating that images will be available after running the tool, or modify the README to explain that users can generate their own examples of different themes.
